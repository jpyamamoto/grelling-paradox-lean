# Grelling's Paradox

Proof that in the Simple Type Theory (as stated in `Grelling/Theory.lean`) the **Grelling's Paradox** can be derived.

This proof has no computational-content due to the proof requiring impredicative quantification which is only achievable in `Prop`.

This proof is presented using Classical reasoning, in particular appealing to the Law of Excluded Middle. There are other formulations that use Intuionistic reasoning.

The proof can be found on `Grelling/Proof.lean`.
